# IEEE Web Task
<p> 
  IEEE Web task was a volunteer website which I designed for <b>IEEE Web development team </b> as a web task. It helped me a lot in learning to make a <b>User-friendly</b> website. I hosted this using <b>Microsoft Azure</b> instead of Github pages. I got a great experienced of creatig a <b>Web Server</b>. Though it was not very complicated but yet it was helpful.</p>
